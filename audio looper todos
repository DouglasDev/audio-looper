-get basic recording functionality to work!!
-add preroll - 
	-count down clock
	-get position in measure: 
	bar has 4 beats - pre-roll 5 beats - start on beat 4 	
	bar has 4 beats - pre-roll 6 beats - start on beat 3 	
	bar has 4 beats - pre-roll 7 beats - start on beat 2 
	equation: 4-((n-1)%4) - need to test further
	beatsInMeasure-((prerollBeats-1)%beatsInMeasure)
	-need to start recording .5 seconds early - if preroll is less than .5 seconds add "pre-pre-roll"
	-playback - start audio track .5s+time delta
-add looping 
	- make sure to end loop so that loop length exactly matches metronome length - use sound sprites??
	
-decide - use my code or demo code?
-aligning clips - manual method?
-aligning clips - try to auto adjust?
	-start recording and play sound, save time, wait for difference of 10 plus decibels, get time delta
