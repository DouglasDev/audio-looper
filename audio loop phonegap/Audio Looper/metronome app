1. You set up the number of bars, and the time signature, and then you can record with a pre-roll so that you can be playing already when the recording kicks in

2. Once it has recorded the set number of bars, it stops recording, and you play the recording in a loop

3. You can change the playback BPM without changing the pitch (there must be a plug-in for this)

4. Volume control. Start / Stop. Record. 
Save. Load Files to save and recall loops from local file system. A loop file will need to reference the audio, the metronome settings, and number of bars that the audio was recorded under.

5. First version single track. Eventually could be multi-track. "Music Maker" is an example (but interface is not easy to use, and preloaded tracks are useless.

6. When multi-track is implemented, each track will have independent Solo, Mute, Pan, and Volume controls. There will also be a master volume control.
